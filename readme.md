## Problem Statement
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a vast collection of metrics and statistics. The objective of this project is to extract and process this data, enabling the generation of user-friendly visualizations that provide valuable insights.

##  Technology Stack Used:
1. Python
2. PostgresSQL
3. Streamlit
4. Github Cloning
5. Geo Visualisation
6. Plotly Express
7. Pandas


## Approach:

1. Data Extraction: The data is obtained from the Phonepe pulse Github repository using scripting techniques and cloned for further processing.
2. Data Transformation: The extracted data is formatted into a suitable structure, ensuring it is clean and ready for analysis. Pre-processing tasks may be performed as necessary.
3. Database Integration: The transformed data is inserted into a MySQL database, offering efficient storage and retrieval capabilities.
4. Live Geo Visualization Dashboard: Python's Streamlit and Plotly libraries are utilized to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. This dashboard presents the data in real-time, enabling users to explore the insights effectively.
5. Database Integration with the Dashboard: The relevant data is fetched from the MySQL database and seamlessly integrated into the dashboard, ensuring the displayed information is up-to-date and accurate.
6. User-Selectable Dropdown Options: The dashboard incorporates a minimum of 10 distinct dropdown options, providing users with the ability to select and view various facts and figures of interest. This feature enhances the customization and flexibility of the dashboard.

The Streamlit app provides an intuitive interface to interact with the charts and explore the data visually. Users can customize the visualizations, filter data, and zoom in or out to focus on specific aspects of the analysis.
